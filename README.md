# Pipelined-fir-filter

above verilog file is the implementation of pipelined fir filter on 7 series fpga atrix 7 fpga kit.
this is my m.tech minor project.
most of the information you will find in the project report.
i used xilinx vivado tool to implement this. after implementaion it is using dspe slices that makes sence when you see the implemented filter structure and dspe slice structure.
their might be some error so let me know i will correct it and upload again.

If you are new to this i would suggest you to do this by yourself you will learn a lot.

The verilog code is the implementation of pipelined fir structure that is shown in page no. 7 of the filter report.
