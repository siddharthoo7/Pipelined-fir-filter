# Pipelined-fir-filter

above verilog file is the implementation of pipelined fir filter on 7 series fpga atrix 7 fpga kit.
this is my m.tech minor project.
most of the information you will find in the project report.
i used xilinx vivado tool to implement this. after implementaion it is using DSP48E1 Slice that makes sence when you see the implemented filter structure and DSP48E1 Slice structure.
if there is some error let me know i will correct it and upload again.

The verilog code is the implementation of "pipelined fir structure" that is shown in "page no. 6 of the filter report" .
